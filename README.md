This project includes sample and template code with descriptions and notes for esp32 modules using Arduino code. Most should work with ESP8266 as well.

To evolve and expand as time and other resources permit.

The intended way to view the project descriptions amd documentation is through the [project github pages](https://mmerlin.github.io/esduino/). The content there is linked to allow easy browsing among topics. It also provides links to download individual files, or to jump to specific folders here in the project repository.

GOALS:

* template code for common functions
* readability for learning and hacking
* links to reference information
